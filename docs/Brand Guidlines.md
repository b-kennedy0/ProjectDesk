# ProjectDesk Brand Guidelines

## 1\. Brand Overview

ProjectDesk is a modern academic project management platform designed for students, researchers, and collaborators. The brand combines calm academic sophistication with the clarity and functionality of modern technology. Its visual identity emphasises structure, focus, and collaboration.

## 2\. Logo Usage

The ProjectDesk logo consists of a geometric desk icon paired with a minimalist sans-serif wordmark. It is available in both light and dark versions for use on varying backgrounds. The icon alone can be used as a favicon or app badge.

## 3\. Colour Palette

ProjectDesk uses a calm, academic colour palette designed for focus and readability. The combination of muted greens, slate blues, and off-whites provides a professional yet approachable tone.

| Colour Name | HEX | Sample |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slate Blue (Text / Primary) | #2C3E50 |     |
| Muted Green (Accent / Icon) | #5D7E72 |     |
| Off-White (Background Light) | #F7F5EF |     |
| Dark Navy (Background Dark) | #121B1F |     |

## 4\. Typography

Typography in ProjectDesk reflects clarity and balance. A modern sans-serif typeface ensures readability and professionalism. Recommended fonts include:

• Primary Font: Inter (for UI and general text)

• Secondary Font: Lora (for headings and accent text)

• Fallback Fonts: Arial, Helvetica, or system sans-serif

## 5\. Tone of Voice

ProjectDesk communicates with calm authority. Its tone is professional yet accessible, academic without pretension. Messages should be clear, concise, and structured - reflecting the platform's purpose of bringing order to complex work.

## 6\. Iconography & Visual Elements

Icons follow the same visual language as the primary logo: geometric, minimal, and precise. Avoid gradients, unnecessary embellishments, or playful styles. Use flat colour fills consistent with the core palette.

## 7\. Summary

These guidelines ensure consistency and recognisability across all digital and printed materials. Maintain visual clarity, consistent typography, and correct colour usage to preserve the calm academic character of ProjectDesk.
